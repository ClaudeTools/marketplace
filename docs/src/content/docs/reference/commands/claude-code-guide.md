> **Status:** 🆕 New in v4.0 — migrated to native command format in the v4.0.0 release

Best practices reference for building Claude Code extensions — skills, hooks, agents, plugins, slash commands, scripts, MCP servers, CLAUDE.md, memory, and task systems.

## Invocation

```
/claude-code-guide [what-you-are-building]
```

**Arguments:** One of: `skill`, `hook`, `agent`, `plugin`, `script`, `mcp-server`, `claude-md`, `memory`, `prompts`

## Routing

The command reads `$ARGUMENTS` to load only the relevant reference file. Only one reference is loaded per invocation.

| Building... | Reference Loaded |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `skill` | `skills-guide.md` |
| `hook` | `hooks-guide.md` |
| `agent` | `agents-guide.md` |
| `prompts` | `prompting-guide.md` |
| `claude-md` | `claude-md-guide.md` |
| `mcp-server` | `mcp-servers-guide.md` |
| `plugin` | `plugins-guide.md` |
| `memory` or `task` | `memory-task-guide.md` |

If the intent spans multiple types, both relevant references are loaded.

## Universal Principles

Loaded for all invocations (not included in referenced files):
- Deterministic tooling over AI inference — if a shell command can do it, use it
- Verify before claiming done — run the checker, don't trust "looks correct"
- No stubs or placeholders — implement fully or say you can't

## Quick example

```
/claude-code-guide skill
```

**Claude responds:**

```
Loaded: skills-guide.md

A claudetools skill is a markdown file that defines a reusable workflow.
Claude reads the skill prompt and follows it when invoked via /skill-name.

Anatomy of a skill:
  SKILL.md        — the workflow prompt (required)
  scripts/        — helper scripts the prompt can reference (optional)
  assets/         — static files (optional)

Minimal skill:
  /plugin/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

  description: What this skill does
  ---
  Do X, then Y, then Z. Use the Bash tool to run checks.

Invoke via:
  /my-skill [optional arguments]
```

## Examples

```
/claude-code-guide skill
/claude-code-guide hook
/claude-code-guide mcp-server
/claude-code-guide plugin
```
